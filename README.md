A text-based game made (not made) for a competition.

The game will center around deciphering audio

How it will work:

You will be given an audio file and asked to transcribe the melody

-Plan:
-Play audio then ask if want to play it again
-accept input of string and validate it
-possibly? play audio and string together
-ask if acceptable
